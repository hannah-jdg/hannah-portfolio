        <h2>Hello & Welcome</h2>
        <p>Let me introduce myself, my name is Hannah (but I’m sure you know that by now). I’m an Interaction Design student based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

            I have always loved art and design, and I’m delighted to be combining that passion with my long time interest in technology. 
            
            As someone who is curious by nature, I’m always looking for new challenges to learn and grow as a creative problem-solver. I’m highly interested in learning more about accessibility while still creating enjoyable and fresh experiences for all.
            
            When I’m not studying, you can find me searching for coffee shops or meandering around Vancouver (preferably by the ocean and mountains).
        </p>
